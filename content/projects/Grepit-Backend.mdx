## 🚀 How It Works:-

-   The creator has the option to create multiple MCQ type questions.
-   Other users can join the room entering the code.
-   Once the creator starts the quiz, each question will be displayed one-by-one, each having a timer and points awarded based on how fast one answers.
-   At the end of the quiz, you will be able to view a leaderboard. The creator can now restart the quiz (having the option to reset the questions).
-   Features can be implemented to archive the room and the leaderboard.
